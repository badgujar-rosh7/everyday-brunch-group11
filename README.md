# Web Programming (CS 546) Final Project
## Overview
This is the repository for the final project for Web Programming (CS 546) at Stevens Institute of Technology.

This project aims to create a system to help users to order brunch from Everyday Brunch Restaurant. The website allows users to register first and then log in and search for their favourite brunch items from the restaurantâ€™s menu. Further, the user can also place an order online using the website and receive an order confirmation on his/her specified email. The system also allows users to add reviews of their orders.

## Dependencies
* Node dependencies are handled by npm -- simply run `npm install` in the project directory, and the Node packages used in the project will be automatically installed.
* Be sure that Mongodb is Running

## Steps to Run
1. Run MongoDB on your machine.
2. In Node.js command prompt, go to the project directory.
3. Install node dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. If you would like to prepopulate the site with accounts/item entries, run `npm run seed` before continuing to the next step.
5. Start the application by running `npm start`.
6. On your web browser, go to `http://localhost:3000/` to access the website.
